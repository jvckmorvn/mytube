## Introduction

This is a mock video sharing service built to practice more advanced Java concepts like interfaces and dependency injection. The program probably isn't that much fun from a user perspective (it just prints some text to the terminal) - the real point was to make sure I understood how every component was working with every other component, identifying potential dependencies, and decoupling classes wherever possible through individual implementations of shared interfaces.

## Installation

- Pull the project from this public repository.
- Navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal.
- Finally, run `java -jar mytube.jar` to start the program.
